Hey! I'm Vamshidhar. I develop robust and maintainable software using Go, Flutter & AWS.

>  "Code. It can be beautiful. When I learned to program, I saw that it
            was... pure. No ambiguities. Nothing to interpret, nothing to
            convey. It just is. The world we live in is incomplete. Fragile and
            blurry. In the binary world, there are only ones and zeros. That's
            pefection. All you need to get started is an idea. And then slowly,
            one command at a time, you create something new. Something pure
            and... true that, didn't exist before. Something that never lies or
            pretends to be something it isn't. A universe out of nothing. You
            take the ugly chaotic world we live in and you make it perfect." - Playlist
